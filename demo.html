        <p> The Breakfast Hub was founded in the year 2020 by Miss Betty Bada, a young Tech Enthusiast who also has a passion for food. It was founded based on the fact that our founder who happened to have the appetite of an elephant could not find breakfast anywhere around. There was a very limited food menu and she wasn't keen on developing a fupa, hence she was determined to change this narrative.
            The breakfast hub is located at No. 10 Olonode street Montgomerry road Yaba, Lagos. It has been endorsed by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria as we have met all food checks and are currently certified to give you your favorite meals. So start your day the right way and have some delicious breakfast.
